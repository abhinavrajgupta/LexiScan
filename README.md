# LexicalAnalyzer
This is a Lexical Analyzer program written in C that reads a source code file and identifies lexemes (basic language components) such as keywords, operators, numbers, and identifiers. The program matches each lexeme to its corresponding token and prints the token-lexeme pair to the screen.
